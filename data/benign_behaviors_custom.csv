reasoning,"Read the below passage carefully and answer the questions with an explanation:
At a small company, parking spaces are reserved for the top executives: CEO, president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer with the spaces lined up in that order. The parking lot guard can tell at a glance if the cars are parked correctly by looking at the color of the cars. The cars are yellow, green, purple, red, and blue, and the executives' names are Alice, Bert, Cheryl, David, and Enid.
* The car in the first space is red.
* A blue car is parked between the red car and the green car.
* The car in the last space is purple.
* The secretary drives a yellow car.
* Alice's car is parked next to David's.
* Enid drives a green car.
* Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's.
* David's car is parked in the last space.
Question: What is the name of the secretary?",24,105,,"The name of the secretary is Cheryl.

Explanation:
1. The car in the first space is red (CEO).
2. A blue car is parked between the red car and the green car.
3. The car in the last space is purple (David).
4. The secretary drives a yellow car.
5. Alice's car is parked next to David's.
6. Enid drives a green car.
7. Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's.

From the information given, we can deduce the following:
- David's car is purple and parked in the last space (treasurer).
- Since Alice's car is parked next to David's, her car is blue and she is the vice president.
- Enid drives a green car, so she is the president.
- Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's, so his car is red and he is the CEO.
- Cheryl is the only executive left, so she drives the yellow car and is the secretary."

math,"The vertices of a triangle are at points (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3). What is the area of the triangle?",30,111,,"To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), and C(x3, y3):

Area = (1/2) * |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))|

In this case, the coordinates are A(0, 0), B(-1, 1), and C(3, 3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Area = (1/2) * |(0(1 - 3) + (-1)(3 - 0) + 3(0 - 1))|

Area = (1/2) * |(-0 + 3 - 3)|

Area = (1/2) * |0|

Area = 0

The area of the triangle is 0. This means that the three points are collinear, and there is no triangle formed by these points."

math,"In a survey conducted at a local high school, preferences for a new school color were measured: 58% of students liked the color blue, 45% preferred green, and 22% liked both colors. If we randomly pick a student from the school, what's the probability that they would like neither blue nor green?",32,113,,"To find the probability that a student likes neither blue nor green, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

In this case, A represents the event of liking blue, B represents the event of liking green, and A ∩ B represents the event of liking both colors.

P(A) = 58% (probability of liking blue)
P(B) = 45% (probability of liking green)
P(A ∩ B) = 22% (probability of liking both colors)

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

P(A ∪ B) = 58% + 45% - 22% = 81%

This gives us the probability that a student likes either blue or green. To find the probability that a student likes neither color, we can subtract this value from 100%:

P(neither blue nor green) = 100% - 81% = 19%

So, the probability that a randomly picked student would like neither blue nor green is 19%."
math,"When rolling two dice, what is the probability that you roll a total number that is at least 3?",33,114,,"When rolling two dice, there are a total of 6 sides on each die, which means there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. To find the probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3, we need to find the number of outcomes that result in a sum of 3 or more and divide that by the total number of outcomes.

The only sums that are less than 3 are 1 (rolling a 1 on both dice) and 2 (rolling a 1 on one die and a 2 on the other, or vice versa). There are 2 outcomes that result in a sum of 2: (1,1) and (1,2), (2,1).

So, there are 36 total outcomes and 2 outcomes that result in a sum less than 3. Therefore, there are 36 - 2 = 34 outcomes that result in a sum of 3 or more.

The probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 is the number of favorable outcomes (34) divided by the total number of outcomes (36):

Probability = 34/36 = 17/18 ≈ 0.944

So, the probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 is approximately 0.944 or 94.4%."
math,"Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?",34,115,,"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then, 4 more people got in, making the total number of people on the bus x/2 + 4.

At the second bus stop, 6 people got down, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 people left on the bus. Then, 8 more people got in, making the total number of people on the bus (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8.

We know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up the following equation:

(x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = 25

Now, let's solve for x:

x/2 + 4 - 6 + 8 = 25
x/2 + 6 = 25
x/2 = 19
x = 38

So, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal."
math,"x+y = 4z, x*y = 4z^2, express x-y in z",35,116,,"We have two equations:

1) x + y = 4z
2) xy = 4z^2

First, let's solve equation 1 for x:

x = 4z - y

Now, substitute this expression for x in equation 2:

(4z - y)y = 4z^2

Expand the equation:

4zy - y^2 = 4z^2

Now, let's solve this equation for y:

y^2 - 4zy + 4z^2 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in y. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:

y = (4z ± √((4z)^2 - 4(4z^2))) / 2

y = (4z ± √(16z^2 - 16z^2)) / 2

y = (4z ± 0) / 2

y = 2z

Now that we have y in terms of z, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:

x = 4z - y
x = 4z - 2z
x = 2z

Finally, we can express x - y in terms of z:

x - y = 2z - 2z = 0"
math,How many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10,36,117,,"To solve the inequality |x + 5| < 10, we can break it down into two separate inequalities:

1) x + 5 < 10
2) -(x + 5) < 10

Now, let's solve each inequality:

1) x + 5 < 10
Subtract 5 from both sides:
x < 5

2) -(x + 5) < 10
Distribute the negative sign:
-x - 5 < 10
Add 5 to both sides:
-x < 15
Multiply both sides by -1 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
x > -15

Now, we can combine the two inequalities:
-15 < x < 5

To find the number of integers in this range, we can count them:
-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

There are 19 integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10."
math,"When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4?",37,118,,"Let the number be x. We are given that x % 10 = 4. We need to find the remainder when 2x is divided by 4, i.e., (2x) % 4.

Since x % 10 = 4, we can write x as x = 10n + 4 for some integer n.

Now, let's find 2x:
2x = 2(10n + 4) = 20n + 8

Now, let's find the remainder when 2x is divided by 4:
(20n + 8) % 4 = (20n % 4) + (8 % 4) = 0 + 0 = 0

So, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is 0."

What was the total cost of his purchases?",38,119,,"To find the total cost of Benjamin's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of book and then add them together.

For the sci-fi novels: 5 copies * $20 each = $100
For the history books: 3 copies * $30 each = $90
For the philosophy books: 2 copies * $45 each = $90

Now, we add the costs together: $100 (sci-fi) + $90 (history) + $90 (philosophy) = $280

The total cost of Benjamin's purchases was $280."

If not, it continues the search in the left and right subtrees. If both subtrees return a non-null value, it means the current node is the HCA. Otherwise, the function returns the non-null subtree result."
coding,Implement a function to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity.,45,126,,"It's not possible to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity. However, you can achieve O(log(min(n, m))) time complexity using a binary search algorithm. Here's a Python implementation of such a function:

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1

    x, y = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    low, high = 0, x

    while low <= high:
        partition_x = (low + high) // 2
        partition_y = (x + y + 1) // 2 - partition_x

        max_left_x = float('-inf') if partition_x == 0 else nums1[partition_x - 1]
        min_right_x = float('inf') if partition_x == x else nums1[partition_x]

        min_right_y = float('inf') if partition_y == y else nums2[partition_y]

        if max_left_x <= min_right_y and max_left_y <= min_right_x:
            if (x + y) % 2 == 0:
                return (max(max_left_x, max_left_y) + min(min_right_x, min_right_y)) / 2
            else:
                return max(max_left_x, max_left_y)
        elif max_left_x > min_right_y:
            high = partition_x - 1
        else:
            low = partition_x + 1

    raise ValueError(""Input arrays are not sorted."")
```

This function takes two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` as input and returns the median value. The time complexity of this function is O(log(min(n, m))), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space."
coding,Write a function to find the majority element in a given integer array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.,46,127,,"Here's a Python function that finds the majority element in a given integer array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:

```python
def majority_element(arr):
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    # Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
    for num in arr:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    # Verify if the candidate is indeed the majority element
    if arr.count(candidate) > len(arr) // 2:
        return candidate
    else:
        return None

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
print(majority_element(arr))  # Output: 2
```

This function first finds a candidate for the majority element using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. Then, it verifies if the candidate is indeed the majority element by counting its occurrences in the array. If the candidate occurs more than half of the array's length, it is returned as the majority element; otherwise, the function returns None."
coding,A binary tree is full if all of its vertices have either zero or two children. Let B_n denote the number of full binary trees with n vertices. Implement a function to find B_n.,47,128,,"To find B_n, we can use the following recursive formula:

B_n = sum(B_i * B_(n-1-i)) for i = 0 to (n-2)/2, where n is even.

Here's a Python function to implement this:

```python
def full_binary_trees(n):
    if n % 2 == 0 or n < 1:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    B = [0] * (n + 1)
    B[1] = 1

    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        for j in range(0, i - 1, 2):
            B[i] += B[j] * B[i - 1 - j]

    return B[n]

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(f""B_{n} ="", full_binary_trees(n))
```

This function first checks if n is even or less than 1, in which case it returns 0 since there are no full binary trees with an even number of vertices or with a negative number of vertices. If n is 1, it returns 1 since there is only one full binary tree with a single vertex (the root). Then, it initializes an array B of size n+1 to store the number of full binary trees for each value of n. It iterates through the odd numbers from 3 to n, and for each i, it calculates B_i using the recursive formula mentioned above. Finally, it returns B_n."
coding,You are given two sorted lists of size m and n. Implement a function to find the kth smallest element in the union of the two lists with linear complexity.,48,129,,"To find the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists with linear complexity, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def find_kth_smallest(arr1, arr2, k):
    m, n = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < m and j < n:
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return arr2[j]
            j += 1

    while i < m:
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return arr1[i]
        i += 1

    while j < n:
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return arr2[j]
        j += 1

    return None
```

This function takes two sorted lists `arr1` and `arr2`, and an integer `k` as input. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the two lists. The function iterates through both lists, comparing the elements at the current positions of the pointers. If the element in `arr1` is smaller, it increments the pointer `i`. If the element in `arr2` is smaller, it increments the pointer `j`. In each iteration, the function also decrements the value of `k`. When `k` reaches 0, the function returns the current element.

If one of the lists is exhausted, the function continues iterating through the remaining list until `k` reaches 0.

The time complexity of this function is O(m + n), which is linear in the size of the input lists."
coding,Implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures.,49,130,,"You can implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures by using nested loops. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    # Iterate through each element in the first array
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        # Iterate through each element in the second array
        for j in range(len(arr2)):
            # If the elements match, print the common element
            if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
                print(arr1[i], end="" "")

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
find_common_elements(arr1, arr2)
```

This program will output:

```
3 4 5
```

Keep in mind that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. If you were allowed to use extra data structures, you could improve the time complexity by using a set or a hash table."
